# Stock Sentiment Analysis & Algorithmic Trading Strategy

> NLP-driven stock movement prediction for Apple and Tesla using VADER + TextBlob sentiment analysis on news headlines, classified with Linear Discriminant Analysis, and validated through a backtested algorithmic trading strategy with stop-loss and take-profit controls.

---

## Overview

Stock price movements are influenced heavily by news sentiment. This project builds an end-to-end pipeline that: (1) processes news headline datasets for Apple and Tesla, (2) extracts sentiment signals using VADER and TextBlob, (3) trains a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier to predict next-day price movement direction (up/down), and (4) back-tests a complete trading strategy using those predictions on 10 years of historical OHLC data from Yahoo Finance.

The key deliverable is not just a classifier — it is a full trading simulation with stop-loss (5%), take-profit (10%), win ratio, Sharpe ratio, and portfolio growth metrics, demonstrating whether sentiment signals translate into real alpha.

## Dataset

| Dataset | Description |
|---|---|
| `apple_dataset.csv` | Apple news headlines with binary stock movement labels (1 = up, 0 = down) |
| `tesla_dataset.csv` | Tesla news headlines with binary stock movement labels (1 = up, 0 = down) |
| Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`) | 10 years of daily OHLC data for AAPL and TSLA (2014–2024) |

**Temporal split:**
- Train: headlines before 2020-01-01
- Test: headlines from 2020-01-01 onwards

## Approach / Methodology

### 1. Data Loading & Merging
News headline datasets are loaded for both companies and merged with historical OHLC data from Yahoo Finance on the `Date` column, giving each headline a corresponding set of market prices.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing
- Punctuation removal with regex (`re.sub`)
- Lemmatization using `WordNetLemmatizer` (NLTK)
- Combined all four splits into a single DataFrame for efficient batch preprocessing, then re-split

### 3. Sentiment Feature Extraction
Six sentiment features are extracted per headline:

| Feature | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Polarity` | TextBlob | Sentiment polarity (-1.0 to +1.0) |
| `Subjectivity` | TextBlob | Subjectivity score (0.0 to 1.0) |
| `Compound` | VADER | Overall normalized sentiment score |
| `Positive` | VADER | Proportion of positive tokens |
| `Negative` | VADER | Proportion of negative tokens |
| `Neutral` | VADER | Proportion of neutral tokens |

### 4. Classification
A **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** model is trained on the combined Apple + Tesla training set (pre-2020) using all six sentiment features. LDA was chosen for its interpretability and efficiency on low-dimensional feature sets.

### 5. Backtesting & Trading Strategy
Predicted buy/sell signals are merged with historical OHLC data. A rule-based trading simulator applies:
- **Buy signal (label = 1):** Purchase 100 shares at next open price
- **Sell signal (label = 0):** Sell all held shares at next open price
- **Stop-loss:** Auto-sell if position drops 5% below buy price
- **Take-profit:** Auto-sell if position gains 10% above buy price
- Initial capital: $10,000
